                <p>Structured Query Language (SQL), also known as SEQUEL, was first developed in 1974 by IBM Research Center.
                SQL is a database query language that allows users to query, or request, information from a database and display that data.</p>
                <p>This language allows businesses and individuals to access and manipulate stored data in order to answer specific questions.
                SQL is used by many different industries including Information Technology, Management, Design, and Business. The language is free 
                to use and has simple syntax which makes it easy for anyone to learn.</p>
